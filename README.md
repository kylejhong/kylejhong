## Hello, I'm Kyle.

Iâ€™m a Frontend Developer/Product Designer interested in artistic creativity, human behavior, and technology. I'm currently enrolled at the University of Washington pursuing a B.S. in Informatics.

With access to digital tools at a young age, I began creating interactive experiences through games, animation, and music. I love to make art because I can communicate ideas in a way that transcends language.

Over five years, I led a cross-functional team to build Jaded, managing timelines, coordinating design, and aligning vision across disciplines. The result was a labor of love that launched on Steam and reached over 180,000 players. In this process, I realized my favorite part was designâ€” making careful, intentional decisions to communicate a certain experience. Now, I'm keen to explore what other ways programs can impact people.

Overall, I'm passionate about digital creativity, designing for people, and creating interactive experiences that bring joy to the people around me!
